## Flask Application Design for a Movie Recommender Website

### HTML Files
- **index.html:** Main interface of the website where users can input their preferences and view recommendations.
- **movies.html:** Display a list of movies based on the user's preferences.
- **recommendations.html:** Showcase personalized movie recommendations based on the user's input.

### Routes
- **@app.route('/')**: Root route that renders the index.html file.
- **@app.route('/movies', methods=['GET'])**: Fetches a list of movies from a database or external API based on the user's preferences, and displays them in the movies.html file.
- **@app.route('/recommendations', methods=['POST'])**: Receives the user's preferences via a form, processes them to generate personalized recommendations, and renders the recommendations.html file with the suggested movies.
